* Time Zone Tracker

** TODO
- [ ] auto-select first item in the list on timezone-selector, so the user can just press enter
- [ ] add four icons to timezones for morning/workday/evening/night, and use hover to explain it
- [ ] show time is being refreshed automatically - ideally an analog clock with at least second indicator
  - if a complete clock, make it show local time
- [ ] publish website to Azure / AWS
